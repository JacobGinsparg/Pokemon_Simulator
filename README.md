# Pokemon Simulator

[Pokémon Simulator GitHub repository](https://github.com/JacobGinsparg/Pokemon_Simulator)

This is an ongoing project with two main goals:

1. To create a working simulator for 1v1 Pokémon battles.

2. To use the simulator to explore applications of game theory to Pokémon:
  * Filling out teams to counter different metagames.
  * Considering mathematically correct moves mid-battle.
  * Adjusting strategies as Pokémon are knocked out.

The simulator will be able to read in text files for teams. The files will follow the same import/export format that [Pokémon Showdown](http://pokemonshowdown.com/) uses.

Metagame analysis will be based on the current metagame on [Smogon](http://www.smogon.com/).

Metadata used to generate Pokémon for battle is pulled from [pokeapi.co](http://pokeapi.co/).
